10 financial metrics used:

1. Total Profit/Loss: The sum of all profit/losses from trades.
2. Number of Trades: The total number of trades executed.
3. Average Profit/Loss per Trade: The average profit/loss per trade, 
calculated by dividing the total profit/loss by the number of trades.
4. Sharpe Ratio (annualized): A measure of risk-adjusted return, 
computed as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation of returns 
over a one-year period.
5. Sortino Ratio: Similar to Sharpe Ratio, but using trailing 12-month 
volatility instead of standard deviation.
6. Value-at-Risk (VaR): An estimate of potential losses within a 
confidence interval (e.g., 95%).
7. Expected Return: The average return expected from the strategy, 
calculated as the sum of profits/losses divided by the number of trades.
8. Standard Deviation of Returns: A measure of the volatility of 
returns.
9. Calmar Ratio: A measure of risk-adjusted return, computed as the 
ratio of excess return to maximum drawdown over a one-year period.
10. Information Ratio: A measure of active return (i.e., 
outperformance) relative to the standard deviation of returns


Handling Missing Values:
Dropped rows with missing values in critical columns.
Ensured Size and Price are numeric and dropped rows where conversion fails.

Accurate Metric Calculations:
Sharpe Ratio: Used daily returns and annualized the standard deviation.
Sortino Ratio: Used downside risk for calculation.
Value-at-Risk (VaR): Calculated using quantile method.
Calmar Ratio: Simplified to use cumulative returns for maximum drawdown.
Information Ratio: Calculated against a risk-free benchmark return.

Edge Case Handling:
Handled cases where standard deviation or downside risk could be zero to avoid division by zero errors.
